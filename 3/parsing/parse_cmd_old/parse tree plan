the precedence of the operators:
|| cancels all right cmds if the left cmd is 1
&& cancels all right cmds if the left cmd is 0
| needs pipex as we need the output of old cmd
> >> < << needs dup2 to work with fd
() execute with a copy of the env as you shouldnt affect the original env.
    this encapsulate all what happens inside of it ex: 
    for (cmd1 && cmd2) | cmd 3 if cmd1 failed cmd3 would execute

then commands


**cmd
operator
*left
*right

<<

echo > test



| || && = 2
<< >> < > = 1


//first
find the most precedent opper, then split the string with it.
always put the left of command in left and the right of it in right
then repeat the same process on each side, untill no oper is left


//second


******* dont forget : all the quotes cancel the parantasis, turn them and ther content to literals **********
not really


hello"hello world"hello -> "hellohello worldhello"

hello'hello'"hello" -> hellohellohello
